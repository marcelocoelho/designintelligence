# Design Intelligence

MIT 4.S00 / 4.S12 Design Studio: Design Intelligence

Design Intelligence is a new subject that introduces students to a practical, hands-on approach to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Providing a new lens through which to engage machine learning through aesthetic, form-finding and interaction, the course introduces students to neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and reinforcement learning, as well as how to collect and prepare data for training their own models. Situated within a graphic, product and interaction design context, students will learn to develop a new kind of creative practice that not only actively engages in shaping the future of artificial intelligence, but is also instrumental in addressing its biases and failures.

The course is divided into two parts. In the first half, students will progress through a series of 4 short warm-up exercises that will give exposure and hands-on experience to different neural network architectures and techniques. In the second half, students will develop an independent project, further exploring ideas uncovered during the exercises or pursuing their own interests.
