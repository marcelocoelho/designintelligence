# Simple Color Classifier

This is a simple example of creating and training your own neural network classifier in the browser using ml5.

A classifier is an algorithm that automatically orders or categorizes data into one or more of a set of “classes”. This example takes an RGB color as input and outputs its most likely name: pink-ish, blue-ish, etc. 

In general, the steps for creating and using a neural network looks like this:

Step 1: load data or create some data
Step 2: set your neural network options & initialize your neural network
Step 4: add data to the neural network
Step 5: normalize your data
Step 6: train your neural network
Step 7: use the trained model to make a classification
Step 8: do something with the results
