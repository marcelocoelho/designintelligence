Create a drawing in p5.js that acts as input mask for a GAN (generative adversarial network).  

Add 2 images to the presentation slide deck, a segmentation mask and its generated output, and be ready to talk about them next class (1 min max). 
Starter code will be posted here: https://github.com/marcelocoelho/designintelligence 

Consider
How does using a GAN compare to writing code?
What were some of the limitations or frustrations you encountered?
Any surprises that led to desirable outcomes?
Can you guess anything about the dataset used to train the models?

Bonus (or Alternative)
Create an image using GauGAN2: http://gaugan.org/gaugan2/
